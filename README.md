和原版基本一致，去掉time和日期的选择，增加一个参数：

## monthOrQuarter  number

### 0 代表月份范围选择（默认）

### 1 代表季度范围选择

This date range picker component creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for [Improvely](http://www.improvely.com), 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.

Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats,
a single date picker mode, a time picker, and predefined date ranges.
